## Geometry ##


For the second part of this lab, you need to implement the function compute_f_pos. This time you are given the distances of two objects (
 and ) and their corresponding heights in the physical world ( and  respectively), and for a specified original focal length , you need to estimate the modified focal length  such that the ratio of the heights of the two objects in the image  is the same as the input value , while the height  of the first object remains constant. The description and the notation of the problem is the same as the one presented in the previous part, so you can use it as reference.
